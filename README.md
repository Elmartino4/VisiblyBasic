# Visibly Basic
A pun on Visual Basic, a language which I ironically hate whilst loosely basing this programming language on.
This repo contains some examples of how the syntax is formated in the .pseudo files under the /tests folder, as well as what these files are compiled to as .asm files, which are somewhat human readable.
The source for the compiler/interpretter CLI software is in the /code folder.

The CLI contains the automatically generated tests for validating sorted search algorithms, unsorted search algorithms, and arbitrary sorting algorithms. This includes the ability to change
- The number of tests performed
- The difficulty of the tests (number of data values)
- The verbosity of the output, for debugging purposes
